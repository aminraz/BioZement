This C project was developed during my PhD at University of Oslo. I
collaborated with [Espen Jettestuen](https://github.com/eje74) on this code. We started from a
base code that had been developed in NORCE AS. The original code included
a gecochemical solver and a lattice Boltzmann solver for transport
[1]. New features added to the code to model and simulate microbially
induced calcium carbonate precipitation. The model and results
are presented in a research paper [2].
